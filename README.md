# Acticheck

Acticheck, or Activity Check, is a small project developed to assist smaller games using Adonis-based admin systems in tracking how long players spend on specific teams within their games. The system uses Roblox datastores to effectively track the duration a player remains in a group or team. This is done through a dynamic check system that can be modified or adapted by the developer as needed, and is presented in an easy-to-use UI.

## Project Background

Acticheck was initially built for the Chronos Science Corporation group, which comprises various smaller subgroups representing different roles within their game. The idea for this project arose from a suggestion made by one of the leaders within these groups. Seeing the potential, I decided to develop it as a pet project.

## Key Features

- **Data Privacy:** Acticheck does not send any data outside of Roblox, ensuring the privacy and security of player information.
- **Roblox Open Cloud Compatibility:** The system organizes its data into easy-to-locate scopes, and assigns player identifiable information to records. This allows developers to easily query or delete player data if necessary.
- **Offline Search:** Acticheck supports offline searches, enabling developers to look up players who are not currently in the game or have never been in the game.
- **Full Configurability:** While Acticheck is highly customizable, it was specifically tailored for the Chronos Science Corporation's game. Some tinkering may be required to adapt it to other games.
