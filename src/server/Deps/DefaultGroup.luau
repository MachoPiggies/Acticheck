  If you'd like to add a new group, copy and paste one of the pre-existing ones (not this one), and write the values
  you want in. Any edits made to this script will be overwritten. This script is a placeholder used by the plugin to
  make sure that the groups are in the correct format. Changing this script may break the plugin loader.
